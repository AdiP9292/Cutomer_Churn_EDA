# Customer Churn Analysis with Python

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Customer Churn dataset sourced from Kaggle. The primary objective is to uncover customer behavior patterns and identify key factors contributing to churn using Python's data analysis libraries.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about customer demographics, account details, and service usage in a telecommunications company. It helps to analyze which types of customers are more likely to leave the service and why.

**Key Features**

- customerID: Unique customer identifier

- gender: Gender of the customer

- SeniorCitizen: Indicates if the customer is a senior citizen

- Partner, Dependents: Marital and family status

- tenure: Number of months the customer has stayed

- PhoneService, InternetService, StreamingTV, etc.: Services used

- MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges: Financial metrics

- Churn: Whether the customer has left or stayed (target variable)

## Objectives

- Understand the distribution and relationships among customer attributes
- Identify key patterns and drivers of churn
- Visualize churn rates across various demographics and service features
- Provide actionable insights for churn reduction strategies
  
## Key Insights
- Customers with shorter tenure and higher monthly charges are more likely to churn
  
- Senior citizens have a slightly higher churn rate

- Fiber optic internet users show a higher churn tendency than DSL users

- Customers without dependents or partners are more prone to churn

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**

- **Jupyter Notebook**

- **Pandas** – Data handling and wrangling

- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization

- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
